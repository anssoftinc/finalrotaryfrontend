      .getEvents()
      .then(data => {
        this.events = data.data;
        this.isLoaded = true;
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  }

api.js
const baseUrl = "https://rotaryclubkathmandumid-town.org/admin/wp-json/wp/v2/";
import axios from "axios";

    getEvents() {
        return axios.get(baseUrl + 'events');
    }

The Wordpress is used as a Headless CMS which means its only used for the Admin dashboard. For that purpose several plugins were used which you can study using the credentials provided already. The name of the plugin is CPT/UI. You can easily ADD/Remove/Edit/Delete existing custom data types.
You can use the following paths to fetch the data from api
https://rotaryclubkathmandumid-town.org/admin/wp-json/wp/v2/{custom field name} 

For example if you create a new custom field name "blog" , your path would be
https://rotaryclubkathmandumid-town.org/admin/wp-json/wp/v2/blogs
