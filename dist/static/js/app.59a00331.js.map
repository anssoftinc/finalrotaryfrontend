Informative circulars of events and meetings have been dis¬patched regularly Fellowship: warm fellowship and hospitality to Rotarians and other friends is a strong point of the club. The bond among the members and family as well friends are strengthened through involvement in various events eg picnic,</p>\r\n    <div class=\"image float-left mr-3\">\r\n      <img src=\"/images/brief/picture3.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"caption text-center\"\r\n      >(President Gopal delivering his speech during the installation ceremony)</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"image float-left mr-3\">\r\n      <img src=\"/images/brief/picture4.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\r\n      <p class=\"caption text-center\">\r\n        Pre PETS session at Chitwan (23/1/99) from Kathmandu Mid¬\r\n        Town PE Giridhar/PP Dr Lekha\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>activities, programs, etc. The club has a good rapport and warm relationship with the young generation (Rotaracts/Interacts/ school children) as well as the community people. The combined effort as partners in service has pro¬moted the image of Rotary in different regions of the valley. The club has also established relationship with out of valley clubs of Nepal eg Chitwan / Butwal / Lumbini working jointly to promote the ideals of Rotary. This year once again a new club of Dillibazaar has been sponsored in conjunction with R Patan West. For the third time in 10 years the club is once more hosting the District event of PETS & SETS / District Assembly. Image promotion & Public Relation has been possible through the individual effort of the members as well as the wide circula¬tion of the regular monthly bulletin \"The Breakfast Chatter\" which has been appreciated by even International dignitaries like PRIP Raja Saboo / and other International dignitaries. The editorial board has made great effort to hightlight its many activities working with its partners in service the Rotaract, Interact and the community. Rotary Clubs of Chitwan & Butwal have recognized our member PP Dr Chandra Lekha as Honorary member of their club. The club is therefore well informed through the regular issues of the Breakfast Chatter which has also found its way to International countries.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Avenue Vocational Service</h4>\r\n    <p>To generate</p>\r\n    <ol type=\"1\">\r\n      <li>Vocational awareness among the young generation talk program were given by the following Rotarians Rtn Ajaya Ghimire on \"Financial Management\". / PE Girdhar Manandhar on \"Leadership\" for professional development / Rtn Richard Launay on \"Etiquette\" for personality development.</li>\r\n      <li>Career development of women have been supported in a number of ways - sponsoring an extended course in India for 3 nurses working at the Burn Care Unit / Bir Hospital. /sponsoring an advanced course in India for a physiotherapist /supporting the community tailoring center at Kirtipur /Ann Paramjit (of Rtn Saini) has also initiated a knitting and stitching sessions for women of Ramkot village.</li>\r\n      <li>This year Vocational recognition are being awarded to the following: Certificate of recognition for Teacher of the year to Dr Ram Krishna Maharjan of Kirtipur / Cash Award to Mr Kashi Nath Subedi for an overall faithful assistance of the year</li>\r\n      <li>Copies of the \"Declaration of Rotarians in Businesses and Professions\" were specially printed and distributed to new and old members.</li>\r\n      <li>Training the young on a vocation is of considerable concern and challenge. Child labour has been bitterly opposed but little or no thought has been given to what to do with them even after basic education available to a low percentage of youth. After gaining their confidence by being with them they have been trained at the medical clinic of which Rtn. Luke is the director. Here an average of 15,000 patients per month and more are provided with service. 5 of the disabled children sponsored by Rtn Luke are currently employed. With the sup¬port of Rotary club of USA 13 more children are at various stages of education they will eventually be absorbed into med¬ical training at the clinic. 13 other children have been placed in different vocation with some pursuing higher education and some have also acquired good jobs.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"row\">\r\n      <div class=\"col\">\r\n        <img src=\"/images/brief/picture5.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p class=\"caption\">\r\n          Talk program for the youth by PE Giridhar on \"Leadership\" for\r\n          professional development\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"col\">\r\n        <img src=\"/images/brief/picture6.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\r\n        <p class=\"caption\">\r\n          Talk program on \"Etiquette\" for personality development by Rtn\r\n          Richard Launay\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"col\">\r\n        <img src=\"/images/brief/picture7.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\r\n        <p class=\"caption\">\r\n          Talk program for the young generation by Rtn Ajaya Ghimire on \"\r\n          Financial Management \"\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Avenue Community Service</h4>\r\n    <p>The club has focused on</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Human development: to promote the welfare of all human beings in the community.</li>\r\n      <li>Community development: service activities designed to build a better community physically.</li>\r\n      <li>Environmental protection: with focus to \"preserve planet earth.</li>\r\n      <li>Partners in service : leadership training to Rotary spon¬sored groups eg Rotaracts /Interacts RVC.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <ol type=\"A\">\r\n      <li>Human development through better education I) 7 girl children of the poor have been supported for the last 5 years.

The Mata Tirtha Old Age Home is a grass roots initiative that has been operating for a few years – they rescue abandoned older women and give then long-term food and shelter. They operate on a very meagre budget, we hope to make a difference by helping them to become more sustainable and by bringing some positive and much-needed changes.reness and an on-going campaign to distribute much-needed first-aid and prevention information.\r\n                  <br />This year our Club members, in collaboration with spouses, have taken on to help the Mata Tirtha Old Age Home. One of our members has recently provided the help of 11 housekeeping students to help clean the home and also teach the caretaker how to properly utilize the cleaning material. Another member has offered to provide a free heath camp for these seniors through the Business and Professional Women of Nepal in collaboration with Daya Foundation. One member has provided drapery and yet another has generously offered to help with the construction of much-needed toilets.
