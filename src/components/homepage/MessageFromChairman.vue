              Recent events related to the global pandemic are changing the new
              world order, and we are all now experiencing the horrible effects
              of the lockdown. It is clear that the old way of doing things will
              not solve the current or future situation. We have already started
              reaching out to people who have been badly affected and it is
              clear that we will need to continue to do so. We in Rotary need to
              be innovative and creative in regard to the ways of supporting our
              fellow citizens both those who are here in the country and, during
              the transition phase, those who will be returning from abroad
              because of COVID 19–related shutdowns. The challenges will be many
              especially because of the huge pressure on the economy to provide
              employment to them while coping with significantly reduced
              revenues from the remittances on which the country relies so
              heavily. <br />
              Let us open our hearts and minds to reach out to the maximum
              possible number of people crying out for help. All Rotarians have
              pledged to <b>“Service Above Self"</b>. Such an opportunity to actively
              serve humanity and the world comes once in a lifetime. We can take
              part by helping our fellow citizens in the areas of education,
              health, and agricultural activities. Our RI Presidential theme
              this year is ‘Rotary Opens Opportunities’. Let us all believe it.
              What a prediction it was! The opportunities alluded to are now our
              compulsions.

           <p>
          So let's prepare ourselves to support national and local authorities
          and NGOs to meet the challenges and extend our helping hands to the
          needy, to help reinstate their confidence and give them HOPE for a
          better tomorrow. Together we can do it. So let's all march forward
          together. I will be with you in-step, all the time.

              Let me congratulate you for taking the responsibility of the
              leadership of your club. Rotary club's leadership is something
              which is most enjoyable. Along with fun it is very important that
              we understand our responsibilities and work hard to achieve our
              goals. We are passing through a very unprecedented time. Something
              we have never witnessed in our whole life. The suffering and the
              threat that many are facing are at times unbearable. But as they
              say “when the going gets tough the tough get going” we Rotarians
              are also tough people and we also need to get going to help and
              assist people who are in difficulty during this time of pandemic.
              As this pandemic is going to remain here for a long time I think
              each club should identify the people, the community where our help
              is required the most and move ahead to assist them. In doing so we
              also need to make sure that we keep the virus at bay from
              ourselves and our family.

              The Rotary year 2020-2021 is going to be a very different year for
              all of us. Lot of Rotary programmes are going to be on virtual
              platform. During the challenging times we have to do challenging
              things and the most challenging task will be for the clubs to have
              their regular weekly meetings. I know these meetings cannot be in
              person but we can always stay in touch with our club friends
              through virtual meetings. These virtual meetings will certainly
              help members to be engaged with Rotary.

        <p class="text-justify">
          Doing service projects will be another challenge. But this also should
          not be very difficult as we can plan our projects now and implement
          them once things become normal which I know will happen very soon.

          Rotary Club of Kathmandu Mid-Town is a club which has been doing great
          work in our District and expectation from this club is very high. I
          urge each member of this club to adapt to the new environment during
          this crisis and take advantage of the new opportunities. Our RI
          President Rtn. Holgar Knaack has given us the theme “Rotary Opens
          Opportunities” and we all know it certainly does. So let us all
          "Trailblazers" get together to open this opportunity with the mindset
          of "Together We Can." I wish each and every one of you a very
          enjoyable Rotary Year.

              Ask any Rotarian what led them to Rotary, and you’ll usually get
              different answers. Why? Not only does Rotary mean different things
              to members in different parts of the world, it also has a unique
              meaning for each Rotarian. <br />
              However, we are all brought together in three important ways. We
              believe in Rotary values and all share the same Four Way Test. We
              believe in friendships and love spending time together. And we
              take great satisfaction in helping others – we are committed to
              Service. <br />
              The District Board has assumed important responsibilities and I
              thank them for this hard work. They have made a commitment to help
              grow Rotary, adapt to the digital future and make Rotary more
              appealing to younger generations. <br />
              We have important work in front of us and so many opportunities to
              open for others and ourselves. <br />
              I hope you will continue your journey with us, as we continue to
              serve our communities so that future generations can thrive as
              Rotary Opens Opportunities.

              At Rotary, we have no tolerance for racism. Promoting respect,
              celebrating diversity, demanding ethical leadership, and working
              tirelessly to advance peace are central tenets of our work.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              We have more work to do to create more just, open and welcoming
              communities for all people. <br />
              We know there are no easy fixes and that challenging conversations
              and work lie before all of us. Rotary’s strength has long been our
              ability and commitment to bringing people together. We will tap
              into that strength now as we stand with those who are working for
              peace and justice. Rotary will do our part to listen, learn and
              take action to ensure that we continue to contribute to making
              positive change.
