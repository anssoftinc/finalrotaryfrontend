            The Rotaract Club of Kathmandu Mid-Town, was chartered on 16 February 1998. Over the past 19 years our Rotractors have been involved in numerous noteworthy projects and have received many RID 3292 and Rotary International accolades for their work. But, most of all, our Rotractors need to be recognized for the outstanding, selfless work that they did and continue to do for the earthquake relief effort both in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and to this day.

          >They have won the ‘best club’ award for the District on numerous occasions and two of our Rotractors have gone on to become District Rotract Representatives (Rtr Samir Nepal and Rtr Saugat Gautam). In 2014 they were selected for and successfully hosted the Rotaract District Conference in Kathmandu; they were also awarded the Rotary International Peace Grant for their good work in providing a water supply system in Kavre District. This year, in collaboration with our Charter President Dr Roop Jyoti, who is an Arch Klumph Society Member’s Circle, 10 of our Rotracts became Paul Harris Fellows in April 2019.</p>
