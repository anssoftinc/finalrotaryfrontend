            The orphanage is a non-governmental, non-profit organization located in the Kathmandu Valley; it caters to the needs of orphaned, needy and deprived children. This ongoing multi-year project has supported renovation and maintenance of the hostel building after the earthquake and has also contributed to a multifaceted sanitation project that has included installing a modern kitchen, local drainage and facilities for proper dish washing and hand washing as well as a water supply system, more outer toilets and a bio gas plant. The project has been supported by the Rotary Club of Livermore, CA, USA and Rotary Club Milano Villoresi, Italy; as well as Rotary Kathmandu Mid-Townâ€™s Earthquake Fund. This project is
            looking for funding to continue its good work.
