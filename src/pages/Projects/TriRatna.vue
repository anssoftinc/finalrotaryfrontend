          <b>Tri-Ratna Cooperative School, Bungamati –</b>was established in 1992; it educates 232 children from the disadvantaged communities of Bungamati and neighboring villages (Chunikhel, Farsidole, Dukuchhap, Chhampi, Sainbu). It was very badly hit during the 2015 earthquake.
          This project is in collaboration with our Rotary District 3292’s ERRRP (Earthquake Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program) and the
          <b>Rotary Club of Nanaimo Daybreak, Canada.</b>

      <b>Post-earthquake ‘Build back better’ efforts at the Kanti Ishwari School and the Ajad Primary School</b>
      Both of these schools, which are located in very old buildings in Kathmandu’s inner downtown core, were heavily damaged by the 2015 earthquake and have ‘red sticker’ status (unsafe, serious damage). They have not received sufficient post-earthquake reconstruction aid to help them improve the education that they provide to the 200 children of this mostly migrant community. At present they are surviving with the help of small NGO’s and the community.
      With the help of matching funds from our Rotary District 3292’s ERRRP (Earthquake Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program
      <a href>ERRRP</a>, our Earthquake Fund, and the Daya Foundation we will work to
      • Improve the classroom quality/infrastructure, water and sanitation and schooling facilities of the
      <b>Kanti Ishwari School located in Pyafal.</b>
      • Improve the classroom quality/infrastructure and furniture of the
      <b>Sree Ajad Primary School located in Lagan Deukhel.</b>
