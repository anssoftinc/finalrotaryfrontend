              Early years Education Support Project, Sindhupalchok, Nepal, (Global Grant 1979704) in collaboration with RC Ellon, District 1010, Scotland. Schools in Sindhupalchok and Nuwakot areas of rural Nepal will be supported to improve learning in 13 classrooms in selected schools. The program will support schools that have shown willingness to change and are most in need. The grant will support upgrading the standard of the schools in terms of physical environment, teaching and the quality of education. Teachers will be given support and training to adopt modern child friendly learning methods and to take ownership and responsibility for the school environment.
              The project is implemented through our partners at First Steps Himalaya. First Steps Himalaya—Giving children a childhood in the rural Himalaya

            <p class="text-justify p-3">
              Snakebite is one of the most neglected public health issues in rural Nepal. Over the past two years we have made some initial efforts to alleviate suffering in this area by increasing awareness and an on-going campaign to distribute much-needed first-aid and prevention information.

            </h2>

            <p class="text-justify p-3">
              We have taken on the mission to share information with communities so that they are well-informed on how to prevent snakebites and know how to respond with appropriate first-aid when snakebites do occur. And, to share information with and to train healthcare workers so that they are well informed on treatment options.
