    <p>activities, programs, etc. The club has a good rapport and warm relationship with the young generation (Rotaracts/Interacts/ school children) as well as the community people. The combined effort as partners in service has pro¬moted the image of Rotary in different regions of the valley. The club has also established relationship with out of valley clubs of Nepal eg Chitwan / Butwal / Lumbini working jointly to promote the ideals of Rotary. This year once again a new club of Dillibazaar has been sponsored in conjunction with R Patan West. For the third time in 10 years the club is once more hosting the District event of PETS & SETS / District Assembly. Image promotion & Public Relation has been possible through the individual effort of the members as well as the wide circula¬tion of the regular monthly bulletin "The Breakfast Chatter" which has been appreciated by even International dignitaries like PRIP Raja Saboo / and other International dignitaries. The editorial board has made great effort to hightlight its many activities working with its partners in service the Rotaract, Interact and the community. Rotary Clubs of Chitwan & Butwal have recognized our member PP Dr Chandra Lekha as Honorary member of their club. The club is therefore well informed through the regular issues of the Breakfast Chatter which has also found its way to International countries.</p>

    <h4>Avenue Vocational Service</h4>
    <p>To generate</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Vocational awareness among the young generation talk program were given by the following Rotarians Rtn Ajaya Ghimire on "Financial Management". / PE Girdhar Manandhar on "Leadership" for professional development / Rtn Richard Launay on "Etiquette" for personality development.</li>
      <li>Career development of women have been supported in a number of ways - sponsoring an extended course in India for 3 nurses working at the Burn Care Unit / Bir Hospital. /sponsoring an advanced course in India for a physiotherapist /supporting the community tailoring center at Kirtipur /Ann Paramjit (of Rtn Saini) has also initiated a knitting and stitching sessions for women of Ramkot village.</li>

      <li>Copies of the "Declaration of Rotarians in Businesses and Professions" were specially printed and distributed to new and old members.</li>
      <li>Training the young on a vocation is of considerable concern and challenge. Child labour has been bitterly opposed but little or no thought has been given to what to do with them even after basic education available to a low percentage of youth. After gaining their confidence by being with them they have been trained at the medical clinic of which Rtn. Luke is the director. Here an average of 15,000 patients per month and more are provided with service. 5 of the disabled children sponsored by Rtn Luke are currently employed. With the sup¬port of Rotary club of USA 13 more children are at various stages of education they will eventually be absorbed into med¬ical training at the clinic. 13 other children have been placed in different vocation with some pursuing higher education and some have also acquired good jobs.</li>
